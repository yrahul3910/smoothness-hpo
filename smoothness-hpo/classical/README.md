# $\beta-$smoothness results using classical learners

**Note:** Due to a stupid naming convention, this actually has some feedforward network code/results as well. Maybe some day I'll refactor things around.

## File descriptions

* `defect_prediction.py`: Defect prediction code for classical learners.
* `issue_lifetime_prediction.py`: Issue lifetime prediction code for classical learners.
* `parse.py`: Code for parsing the results of the classical learners.
* `results/`: Classical learner results.
* `smoothness/`: Code for computing the $\beta-$smoothness.
